    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```

    ```
     # Track the changes

     git add .
     ```
* Step 6: Commit all the changes (Write commit message as "Small Message")
    ```

2. Participants/contributors have to **comment** on issues they would like to work on, and mentors or the PA will assign you.
3. Issues will be assigned on a **first-come, first-serve basis.**
4. Participants/contributors can also **open their issues** using issue_template,
but it needs to be verified and labelled by a mentor or PA. Please discuss with the team once before opening your issues. We respect all your contributions, whether 
it is an Issue or a Pull Request.
6. When you raise an issue, make sure you get it assigned to you before you start working on that project.
7. Each participant/contributor will be **assigned 1 issue (max)** at a time to work.
8. Participants are expected to follow **project guidelines** and **coding style** . **Structured code** is one of our top priorities.
9. Try to **explain your approach** to solve any issue in the comments. This will increase the chances of you being assigned.

15. Always create a pull request from a **branch** other than `main`.

another person in the queue.
